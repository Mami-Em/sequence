# sequence
is a program that does my math exercises for me
- it is able to deferentiate geometric, arithmetic or fibonacci sequemces
- it is able to determine the value at nth position

# to get started
- install the cs50 library
- open terminal and run the file
- insert how many sequence you are given to, make sure it's more than 3 sequence. press enter
- insert one by one each sequences. press enter
- it is going to tell you the type of sequence you have inserted, you will then, have the choice to go further and determine the value at nth position
